        <br>
        <p>Veg Pulao is a popular, comforting dish from Indian cuisine. It is a one-pot meal that consists of rice, vegetables, spices, and herbs. The key to a good pulao is fluffy, separated grains of rice with the distinct aroma of whole spices like bay leaf, cardamom, and cloves, along with the fresh taste of mint and coriander. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
        <ul>
            <ls>1½ cups Rice.</ls><br>
            <ls>2½ cups water (use 3 cups for a softer texture, or 2 cups for a pressure cooker)</ls><br>
            <ls>2 tablespoons Ghee or Oil</ls><br>
            <ls>1 medium Onion, thinly sliced</ls><br>
            <ls>1 cup Mixed Vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, potatoes, cauliflower), chopped into small, even pieces</ls><br>
            <ls>1-2 Green Chilies, slit</ls><br>
            <ls>1½ teaspoon Ginger-Garlic Paste</ls><br>
            <ls>A handful of fresh Coriander leaves, chopped</ls><br>
            <ls>A few Mint leaves (optional)</ls><br>
            <ls>Salt to taste</ls>
            <ls>1 Bay Leaf, 1-inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini), 4 Cloves (Laung), 4 Green Cardamoms (Elaichi), ½ teaspoon Cumin Seeds (Jeera)</ls>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <ls>1. Rinse and Soak Rice: Rinse 1½ cups basmati rice 3-4 times until the water runs clear. Soak in water for 20–30 minutes. Drain completely and set aside.</ls><br>
            <ls>2. Heat Ghee & Temper Spices: Heat 2 tbsp ghee or oil in a pressure cooker or a heavy-bottomed pot. Add whole spices (cumin, bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, star anise) and sauté for 30 seconds until aromatic. </ls><br>
            <ls>3. Onions & Aromatics: Add sliced onions and slit green chilies. Sauté on medium heat until the onions turn light golden brown. Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.</ls><br>
            <ls>4. Add Veggies & Herbs: Add the chopped vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, potatoes) and mint/coriander leaves. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften slightly.</ls><br>
            <ls>5. Toast the Rice: Add the drained rice and sauté gently for 1-2 minutes, stirring carefully to avoid breaking the grains. This coats the rice in ghee, ensuring it stays separate.</ls><br>
            <ls>6. Add Water & Cook: Pour in 2½ cups of water (or stock) and add salt. The water should taste slightly salty.</ls><br>
            <ls>7. Rest & Serve: Once cooked, let the pulao rest for 10 minutes, then gently fluff with a fork. Garnish with coriander leaves.</ls>
        </ol><br>
